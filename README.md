# Project Name: Grand Theft Auto NYUAD

## Project Description:

Grand Theft Auto is one of the most famous games in the world and in gaming history, as it revolutionized the way we look at games. In this project we decided to mimic the game and make a real life Grand Theft Auto at NYU Abu Dhabi. In order to mimic NYUAD GTA and have a purpose for the story we decided to provide a storyline before jumping to NYUAD GTA. THis project presents a story of a boy at NYUAD that has been constantly bullied and humiliated by people around him. One day he wakes up and turns into a GTA character and that's where all of the fun begins. The project was designed and the idea was taken from the actual GTA game. We added as many details as we can to  resemble the story and make the video along the website look like the actual GTA game. Some of the details included were the character walk, music, hud, map, menu, sounds, and other missions were all taken from the actual game concept, even the design of the images. Overall we were striving to make the user/viewer experience NYUAD life in another lens.  

## Process:

### Ideation



*   From the get go we knew we wanted to work on GTA NYU Abu Dhabi but quickly realized it would be a challenge to do justice to the game maintaining its style whilst incorporating NYUAD into it.

### Script writing



*   We spent a lot of time brainstorming storylines for the main character and ended up going with the story of a bullied student who wants revenge and therefore becomes a GTA character.
*   We wrote the entire script on a shared document with detailed scene information such as the angles, sounds and what movements should be made (GTA style walking for example)

### Video Production



*   Before we shot the video we spent some time actually playing GTA to understand the game dynamic. We then filmed the shots required in our script on an iPhone in the span of 3 days. We took advantage of the, “fish-eye” view on the new iPhone which was very useful for the wide angle GTA shots. Many of the shots required 3 or more reshoots which was time consuming.

### Video Editing



*   Almost all of the sound in the video (except the conversations) was made after the video was filmed as the iPhone microphone caught too much distortion. We added many of the sounds by recording our actual GTA gameplay such as the cloth changing, footstep, shouting in pain etc. Many minor sounds were also recorded and synced afterwards such as the bed cranking when Yusuf wakes up, sanitizer bottle opening etc.
*   We edited fully on Adobe Premiere Pro. We spent a long time learning the ins and outs of premier pro and once we were comfortable with it we were able to add effects that really brought out the GTA vibe:
    *   Health bars on the video that correspond to the main characters health
    *   Money indicator
    *   GTA Map
        *   We screen recorded an actual map and us panned through it for the entire video manually and then used premier pro to turn the square video into a circle.
        *   We also manually added in the arrow at the middle of the map that changes its rotation value manually based on the characters orientation for the entire video.
*   We added multiple GTA soundtracks in the video to create the atmosphere of a GTA game.

### Website Development



*   Our website was heavily inspired by the GTA Universe. All the way from the pricedown font and GTA cursor to the main screen background and pause menu, it carried the GTA theme. The GTA themed parts are listed below:
    *   GTA inspired logo
    *   Header fonts, button fonts : pricedown (GTA’s official font)
    *   GTA middle finger cursor and punch cursor
    *   GTA Main menu background image with character (Al bloom in our case)
    *   GTA pause menu style similar to GTA V pause menu
        *   Transparent tab items and video blur with sepia filter when paused
        *   Pause menu music taken from GTA V pause menu
    *   GTA pause menu font: Chalet London Nineteen Sixty (exact font used in GTA V pause menu screen items)
    *   Ability to type in cheat codes just as in all GTA games to, “unlock” parts of the game and in our case the video
*   Credits:
    *   In the credit design, we also tried to reflect the way the credits are displayed in Real Life GTA, and therefore we decided to display the credits scrolling up and in the background it's the place that is relevant to our story, and in our case NYUAD. We used a video of Saadiyat sunset to display the credits on the screen along the side of our customized GTA logo on the top. When the video ends, the page gets redirected to the credit page immediately, and when the credits are displayed, then the page gets redirected to the main menu.
*   Glitches:
    *   In the Glitches part we included some bloopers that we captured from the filming of the original video. We edited them on premiere pro and we attached them as a video on the webpage as an extra part.

## Reflection/Evaluation:

Through this project we were able to learn a lot about the entire process of video production from start to finish and have learned to appreciate people's hard work in video more. We are proud of our final product and believe it reflects the theme of GTA and NYUAD well. If we were to have more time we would work on the video editing and website even more to add to the GTA environment.
